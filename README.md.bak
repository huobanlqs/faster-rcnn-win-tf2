# faster-rcnn-win-tf2
Tensorflow Faster R-CNN for Windows and Linux by using Python 3

This is the branch to compile Faster R-CNN on Windows and Linux. It is heavily inspired by the great work done [here](https://github.com/dBeker/Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3). I have not implemented anything new but I fixed the implementations for tensorflow2.

Currently, this repository supports Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

If you find a solution to an existing issue in the code, please send a PR for it.
